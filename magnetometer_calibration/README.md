## Reading the data

The `magnetometer_data.csv` was created by the `read_magnetometer.py` script
in the root directory. It records the mangetometer measures (both calibrated and uncalibrated)
in real time and saves them to the csv file.

## Calibrating

Run the `calibrate.m` in Matlab. It reads the `magnetometer_data.csv` and does all
the calibration stuff.
